# contract-clause-generator

Federal Contract Clauses Generator: This application will generate federal contract clauses for supply purchases under Simplified Acquisition Procedures under $250,000. This application will automate and genreate contract clauses based on specific values and parameters entered by the contracting specialist or officer. Once the contract clauses are organized, they are written to a word document or PDF for the contracting specialist or officer to add to the federal contracting document.

## Vision

What took hours and sometimes days to prepare federal contract clauses, will now take only minutes to genrate. This application will bring the federal proccurement process from the 20th century using static excel worksheets into the 21st century using a program that will end the need to copy and paste.
